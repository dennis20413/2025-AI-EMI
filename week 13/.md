### Summary

This interactive report showcases the trends and geographic patterns of global renewable energy:

- The global average renewable energy share has steadily increased since 2000, indicating a global shift toward sustainable energy sources.
- The top-performing countries in recent years include those with strong hydro, solar, or wind programs, such as Norway, Iceland, and Uruguay.
- The choropleth map highlights regional disparities in renewable energy adoption, with Europe and South America leading in renewables share.

As the world transitions toward cleaner energy, monitoring such data helps assess policy impact and investment effectiveness.
