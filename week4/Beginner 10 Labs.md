## Original : 
Elon Musk’s Starship rocket has completed a world first after part of it was captured on its return to the launch pad.

The SpaceX vehicle's lower half manoeuvred back beside its launch tower where it was caught in a giant pair of mechanical arms, as part of its fifth test flight.

It brings SpaceX’s ambition of developing a fully reusable and rapidly deployable rocket a big step closer.

"A day for the history books," engineers at SpaceX declared as the booster landed safely.

The chances of the bottom part of the rocket, known as the Super Heavy booster, being caught so cleanly on the first attempt seemed slim.

Prior to the launch, the SpaceX team said it would not be surprised if the booster was instead directed to land in the Gulf of Mexico.

SpaceX can now point to some extraordinary achievements in the past two test flights. This comes only eighteen months after its inaugural flight, which saw the vehicle blown apart not long after launch.

SpaceX argues that these failures are also part of its development plan - to launch early in the expectation of failure so that it can collect as much data as possible and develop its systems quicker than its rivals.

The initial stages of the ascent of the fifth test were the same as the previous outing, with the Ship and booster separating two and three-quarter minutes after leaving the ground.

At this point the booster began to head back towards the launch site at Boca Chica in Texas.

With just two minutes to go till landing it was still not clear if the attempt would be made, as final checks were carried out by the team operating the tower.

When the flight director gave the go-ahead, cheers went up from SpaceX employees at mission control.

The company had said that thousands of criteria had to be met for the attempt to be made.

As the Super Heavy booster re-entered the atmosphere it slowed down from speeds in excess of a few thousands miles per hour.

When it approached the landing tower, which stands 146m-high (480ft), its raptor engines worked to control its landing. It seemed to almost float, orange flames engulfed the booster and it deftly slotted into the giant mechanical arms.

The Ship part of the rocket, which is where equipment and crew will eventually be held for future missions, fired up its own engines after separating from the booster.

It was successfully landed in the Indian Ocean around forty minutes later.

"Ship landed precisely on target! Second of the two objectives achieved", SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote on X.

Not only was the Ship landed accurately but SpaceX also managed to preserve some of the vehicle's hardware, which it had not expected.

Catching the booster rather than getting it to land on the launch pad reduces the need for complex hardware on the ground and will enable rapid redeployment of the vehicle in the future.

Elon Musk and SpaceX have grand designs that the rocket system will one day take humans to the Moon, and then on to Mars, making our species "multi-planetary".

The US space agency, Nasa, will also be delighted the flight has gone to plan. It has paid the company $2.8bn (£2.14bn) to develop Starship into a lander capable of returning astronauts to the Moon's surface by 2026.

In space terms that is not that far away so Elon Musk's team were eager to get the rocket re-launched as soon as possible.

But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US government body that approves all flights, had previously said there would be no launch before November as it reviewed the company's permits.

Since last month the agency and Elon Musk have been in a public spat after the FAA said it was seeking to fine his company, SpaceX, $633,000 for allegedly failing to follow its license conditions and not getting permits for previous flights.

Before issuing a license, the FAA reviews the impact of the flight, in particular the effect on the environment.

In response to the fine, Musk threatened to sue the agency and SpaceX put out a public blog post hitting back against "false reporting" that part of the rocket was polluting the environment.

Currently the FAA only considers the impact on the immediate environment from rocket launches rather than the wider impacts of the emissions.

Dr Eloise Marais, professor of atmospheric chemistry and air quality at University College London, said the carbon emissions from rockets pale in comparison to other forms of transport but there are other planet-warming pollutants which are not being considered.

"The black carbon is one of the biggest concerns. The Starship rocket is using liquid methane. It's a relatively new propellant, and we don't have very good data of the amount of emissions that are coming from liquid methane," she said.

Dr Marais said what makes black carbon from rockets so concerning is that they release it hundreds of miles higher into the atmosphere than planes, where it can last much longer.

## I would like to extract all of foods name from a travel story

### A random travel diary from google:
WHY FLORENCE  
Florence came into the picture because John and I were about to have our 10 year anniversary from the first time we traveled and lived there together as students. We thought what better way to celebrate this milestone than to relive some of those memories. It turned out to be the best thing for us, we only wished we could have stayed longer than 5-6 days.

HOTEL OR AIRBNB  
Knowing that prices were going to be high to stay in a centrally located hotel for 5 nights, we dedicated to spend our money wisely and Airbnb a 2 bedroom apartment with a kitchen just near the Arno. John’s brother and girlfriend flew in a day after us, and we all stayed in this cute little apartment together. It was clean, cozy and we couldn’t have asked for a better location.

GETTING AROUND  
We spent each day exploring around our new neighborhood by foot. So be sure to bring your comfiest walking shoes since there’s tons of exploring to be had. My feet loved being in footwear by Joules. I wore their cute sandals all day, everyday and I got zero blisters. I was happy. However, it was SO HOT! John and I ended up getting so overheated on the first day that we got sick and needed to spend our second day in bed drinking only electrolytes! On top of that, we were running to the bathroom every few minutes, and it was NOT fun!! So tip #1 – wear comfy shoes and tip#2 – carry drinking water around with you in the hot summer months and limit direct sun exposure.

THINGS TO DO  
Florence offers plenty of activities. We used to live here for a year and we still couldn’t see and do everything after school. TripAdvisor has a pretty comprehensive list of things you can do and I recommend checking it out. As for us, luckily we got around to feeling better the next day for our Radiohead concert. The concert was just under 15 minutes away by cab at the Visarno Arena at the beautiful Parco delle Cascine. We got there around 6pm and had an amazing time. I hadn’t been to a concert that massive in a looooong time! As we were leaving the venue that night, it began to rain. It was perfect in every way as we walked home through the beautiful park with Radiohead still playing in the background. I love these kinds of moments! I’ll be sharing videos on my YouTube channel soon, so stay tuned!

WHERE TO EAT & DRINK IN FLORENCE  
Da Nerbone – By far my favorite spot!!!! It’s located inside Mercato Centrale. Authentic Italian flavors and I died for the mushroom side dish and risotto. We got so many different dishes and everything tasted beyond amazing! Makes the perfect spot for lunch or a casual dinner.

The Westin Excelsior – If you’re looking for some of the best views of Florence and the Arno, the Rooftop Bar is your spot! Amazing cocktails too! Highly recommend this spot out of the others we visited.

I’Tuscani 2 – Craving yummy meat and veggies? This place is simple and delicious.

L’Osteria di Giovanni – We had some amazing filet mignon and house made pasta dishes. Wonderful full course menu to choose from. Very authentic. Highly recommend this place.

Osteria Santo Spirito – Really good risotto and truffle gnocchi! We sat outside and enjoyed it fully.

Shake Cafe – Favorite spot for healthy bites and smoothies.

Caffe Amerini – We discovered some good cafe al ginseng shakerato here. It was basically an iced latte with ginseng and it was SO GOOD. They also have baked goods and a deli.

Gelateria La Carraia – We found this place on our walk back home one night and the line was sooo long! We decided to save it for another night, but now I wish we hadn’t because we ran out of nights before we remembered to go back!

DAY TRIPS  
You can take the train to almost anywhere for the day. I recommend Viareggio or Siena for proximity or a tighter budget. Viareggio is a nice little beach town with good restaurants close to Florence and Siena is a beautiful medieval city. One way is about €9 on Trenitalia and takes no more than 1.5 hours. Alternatively, for the same amount of time you can go visit Rome and a one way ticket is about €35. That’s what we did because we were flying in and out of Rome.

## Original: The Whispering Stars

*In the quiet town of Larkspur, nestled between rolling hills and the endless tapestry of the night sky, lived a young dreamer named Elena. Every evening, after the last light faded from the small, cozy houses, Elena would climb the creaking wooden ladder to her rooftop. There, with only the stars as her companions, she’d gaze upward and imagine that each twinkling light was a message from distant worlds. The townsfolk often joked that Elena was chasing the whispers of the cosmos, but to her, those murmurs carried the secrets of forgotten places and untold adventures.*

*One breezy autumn night, as a golden haze of dusk slowly surrendered to the deep blues of twilight, Elena noticed a star that burned brighter than all the others. It pulsed with an almost rhythmic glow, as if it were alive. Captivated, she made a silent promise: she would follow this guiding light and discover where its whisper led.*

*The very next morning, with a small backpack filled with essentials—a worn map, a notebook, a water bottle, and her grandfather’s compass—Elena set out on her journey. The path was rugged, winding through thick forests and along narrow, babbling brooks that spoke of ancient memories. As she trekked further from Larkspur, the familiar warmth of home gave way to the mysterious chill of the unknown. Yet, every step forward was emboldened by that vision of the brilliant star.*

*After several days of travel, Elena found herself at the edge of a vast, enchanted forest known as the Greenwood. Legend had it that within its depths lay relics of a once-flourishing civilization, now shrouded in mist and mystery. The forest was dense with towering trees, their branches interlaced like a woven tapestry. The deeper she ventured, the more the forest seemed to whisper, carrying faint echoes of ancient lullabies and long-forgotten tales.*

*One afternoon, while resting beside a clear, serene stream, Elena encountered an old traveler named Milo. His eyes sparkled with the wisdom of countless journeys, and his smile was warm despite the hardships written on his weathered face. Over a shared meal of wild berries and freshly gathered herbs, Milo recounted his own adventure. He spoke of a mystical city called Astralon, built by people who believed that the stars held the secrets of life and destiny. According to him, the city had vanished centuries ago, swallowed by time and nature, but its legends lived on in the stories of those who still roamed the wild lands.*

*"Many have searched for Astralon," Milo said in a low, steady voice, "but only those with an unyielding belief in the impossible ever find its gates." His eyes then met Elena’s with an intensity that made her heart race. "Perhaps your bright star is a sign—a beacon meant to guide you there."*

*With newfound determination, Elena bid farewell to Milo and pressed onward, now driven by both curiosity and the stirring hope that Astralon might be real. The days melted into nights as she navigated the labyrinthine paths of the Greenwood. Every rustle in the leaves, every distant call of a night bird, reminded her of the universe’s constant presence, whispering encouragement in a language only the brave could understand.*

*One starlit night, while the forest lay under a silvery shroud of mist, Elena found herself at a clearing surrounded by ancient stone pillars, half-buried and entwined with ivy. The structures, weathered by time, resonated with a mysterious energy. In the center of the clearing stood an intricately carved archway that shimmered faintly under the celestial glow. It was as if the very air around it vibrated with anticipation.*

*With trembling hands, Elena approached the archway. The moment her fingertips brushed against the cool stone, a cascade of memories not her own rushed through her mind—a montage of vibrant celebrations, echoing laughter, and the soft hum of music. She saw visions of a bustling city, its streets aglow with lantern light, its people united by a shared wonder at the mysteries of the cosmos. The whispering stars overhead mirrored the light of those distant festivities, weaving an eternal bond between the heavens and the earth.*

*Realization dawned upon her: she had found the threshold to Astralon. As she stepped through the archway, the world shifted. The dense forest gave way to a sprawling city bathed in the golden light of a setting sun. Here, the architecture was a harmonious blend of nature and human ingenuity—buildings grown from living trees, bridges woven from vines, and fountains that sang with the crystalline sound of flowing water.*

*In the heart of Astralon, Elena discovered a grand plaza where people gathered under the soft glow of countless lanterns. There, an elderly woman with silver hair and kind eyes welcomed her. "Welcome, child of the stars," she said in a voice that was both gentle and powerful. "We have long awaited the one who listens to the whispers of the cosmos."*

*Over the following days, Elena immersed herself in the culture and wisdom of Astralon. The citizens, guardians of ancient knowledge, taught her that every star was a beacon of hope, a guide for those who sought truth in a world of uncertainty. They shared with her the secrets of their art, science, and spirituality, all woven together by the tapestry of the universe. Elena learned that the city had once thrived on the balance of nature and technology, a harmony lost to the outside world but preserved in this hidden sanctuary.*

*In the evenings, Elena would join the Astral Circle—a gathering where citizens shared stories, recited poems, and celebrated the mysteries of the cosmos. It was during one of these nights, as the stars danced overhead, that she finally understood the true meaning of her journey. Her quest was never solely about discovering a lost city; it was about awakening the dormant wonder within herself and reconnecting with the natural rhythm of the universe.*

*Yet, even in this paradise, a lingering sadness haunted the people of Astralon. The city’s ancient guardians had foretold that one day, the balance between nature and progress would tip, threatening not only their sanctuary but the delicate fabric of life beyond its borders. They spoke of a prophecy—of a time when the whispers of the stars would grow into a resounding call for change. Elena, with her unyielding spirit and newfound understanding, felt compelled to help.*

*Drawing on the wisdom of Astralon, Elena embarked on a new mission. With the elders’ blessing, she left the safety of the city to travel back into the wider world, carrying with her the message of balance and harmony. Her journey took her across vast plains, over rugged mountains, and through bustling cities where the pace of life had forgotten the gentle murmur of the universe.*

*In each place, Elena shared the stories of Astralon and the importance of listening to the stars—a reminder that even amidst chaos, there is a constant call to return to our roots, to honor the delicate balance of nature and progress. Her words resonated with many, igniting sparks of hope and inspiring communities to rediscover a harmonious way of living.*

*Years later, as Elena’s hair silvered like that of the wise guardians she once knew, she returned to Larkspur. The town, too, had changed. New gardens bloomed, and quiet corners once abandoned were revived by community efforts inspired by her tales. Standing on her old rooftop, Elena looked up at the sky. The bright, pulsing star still shone, a silent companion to her memories and a beacon for those still willing to listen.*

*Elena smiled, knowing that the whispering stars would continue to guide the hearts of dreamers long after she was gone, forever linking the destiny of humankind with the eternal dance of the cosmos.*

## Original:
Elon Musk’s Starship rocket has completed a world first after part of it was captured on its return to the launch pad.

The SpaceX vehicle's lower half manoeuvred back beside its launch tower where it was caught in a giant pair of mechanical arms, as part of its fifth test flight.

It brings SpaceX’s ambition of developing a fully reusable and rapidly deployable rocket a big step closer.

"A day for the history books," engineers at SpaceX declared as the booster landed safely.

The chances of the bottom part of the rocket, known as the Super Heavy booster, being caught so cleanly on the first attempt seemed slim.

Prior to the launch, the SpaceX team said it would not be surprised if the booster was instead directed to land in the Gulf of Mexico.

SpaceX can now point to some extraordinary achievements in the past two test flights. This comes only eighteen months after its inaugural flight, which saw the vehicle blown apart not long after launch.

SpaceX argues that these failures are also part of its development plan - to launch early in the expectation of failure so that it can collect as much data as possible and develop its systems quicker than its rivals.

The initial stages of the ascent of the fifth test were the same as the previous outing, with the Ship and booster separating two and three-quarter minutes after leaving the ground.

At this point the booster began to head back towards the launch site at Boca Chica in Texas.

With just two minutes to go till landing it was still not clear if the attempt would be made, as final checks were carried out by the team operating the tower.

When the flight director gave the go-ahead, cheers went up from SpaceX employees at mission control.

The company had said that thousands of criteria had to be met for the attempt to be made.

As the Super Heavy booster re-entered the atmosphere it slowed down from speeds in excess of a few thousands miles per hour.

When it approached the landing tower, which stands 146m-high (480ft), its raptor engines worked to control its landing. It seemed to almost float, orange flames engulfed the booster and it deftly slotted into the giant mechanical arms.

The Ship part of the rocket, which is where equipment and crew will eventually be held for future missions, fired up its own engines after separating from the booster.

It was successfully landed in the Indian Ocean around forty minutes later.

"Ship landed precisely on target! Second of the two objectives achieved", SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote on X.

Not only was the Ship landed accurately but SpaceX also managed to preserve some of the vehicle's hardware, which it had not expected.

Catching the booster rather than getting it to land on the launch pad reduces the need for complex hardware on the ground and will enable rapid redeployment of the vehicle in the future.

Elon Musk and SpaceX have grand designs that the rocket system will one day take humans to the Moon, and then on to Mars, making our species "multi-planetary".

The US space agency, Nasa, will also be delighted the flight has gone to plan. It has paid the company $2.8bn (£2.14bn) to develop Starship into a lander capable of returning astronauts to the Moon's surface by 2026.

In space terms that is not that far away so Elon Musk's team were eager to get the rocket re-launched as soon as possible.

But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US government body that approves all flights, had previously said there would be no launch before November as it reviewed the company's permits.

Since last month the agency and Elon Musk have been in a public spat after the FAA said it was seeking to fine his company, SpaceX, $633,000 for allegedly failing to follow its license conditions and not getting permits for previous flights.

Before issuing a license, the FAA reviews the impact of the flight, in particular the effect on the environment.

In response to the fine, Musk threatened to sue the agency and SpaceX put out a public blog post hitting back against "false reporting" that part of the rocket was polluting the environment.

Currently the FAA only considers the impact on the immediate environment from rocket launches rather than the wider impacts of the emissions.

Dr Eloise Marais, professor of atmospheric chemistry and air quality at University College London, said the carbon emissions from rockets pale in comparison to other forms of transport but there are other planet-warming pollutants which are not being considered.

"The black carbon is one of the biggest concerns. The Starship rocket is using liquid methane. It's a relatively new propellant, and we don't have very good data of the amount of emissions that are coming from liquid methane," she said.

Dr Marais said what makes black carbon from rockets so concerning is that they release it hundreds of miles higher into the atmosphere than planes, where it can last much longer.
