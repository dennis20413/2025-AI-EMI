# 1. Prompt Variables (🔣)

## Original
We often need flexible prompts that can accommodate different languages or content placeholders. By designing prompts with variables (like `{Language}` or `{ProductName}`), we can quickly adapt to various scenarios.

## Prompt
Create a template to generate product descriptions using 3 placeholders in English, Chinese, and Japanese.

## result
**Template Example**  

Introducing `{ProductName}` — a versatile item that meets all your `{UserNeed}`. Available now in `{Language}` to ensure maximum clarity and impact.

- Use `{Language}`: “English,” “中文,” “日本語”  
- Use `{ProductName}`: any product name  
- Use `{UserNeed}`: your target benefit or feature

# 2. Automated Template Filling (🖇)

## Original
Sometimes we have a predefined structure for content, such as marketing copy or articles, where we need to automatically insert certain data—like product names, features, or prices—into specific locations.

## Prompt
Please use the following template to write a product description for `[Laptop]`. “[Laptop]” is a `[Type]` with `[Feature1]` and `[Feature2]`, offering `[Advantage]`.

## result
**Filled Description**  
“PolyTech X1 is a **lightweight laptop** with an **ultra-clear display** and **ultra-fast SSD performance**, offering **top-tier portability and speed** for modern professionals.”

# 3. Chain of Thought (CoT, 思維鏈) (🤔)

## Original
When asked a question like “If I have 10 apples, give 3 away, buy 5 more, and eat 1, how many remain?”, many AI systems can answer directly. However, guiding the AI to reason step by step (Chain of Thought) ensures transparency and accuracy.

## Prompt
Show your reasoning steps to solve how many apples remain after the described actions.

## result
1. Start with 10 apples.  
2. Give away 3 (10 - 3 = 7 apples).  
3. Buy 5 more (7 + 5 = 12 apples).  
4. Eat 1 (12 - 1 = 11 apples).  
5. **Answer**: 11 apples remain.

# 4. Multi-Step Math (🧮)

## Original
A car travels at 60 km/h for 4 hours. We want to break down the calculations step by step to explain how far it goes.

## Prompt
Explain the total distance traveled if a car goes 60 km/h for 4 hours, step by step.

## result
1. The speed is 60 kilometers per hour.  
2. The travel time is 4 hours.  
3. Distance = Speed × Time = 60 × 4 = 240.  
4. **Answer**: The car travels 240 kilometers.

# 5. Zero-shot CoT (⚡)

## Original
A student has 20 dollars, buys a pen for 5 dollars, a book for 10 dollars. We want the answer without the model seeing any example solutions first.

## Prompt
How much money remains after these purchases?

## result
- Total initial money: \$20  
- Spent on pen: \$5  
- Spent on book: \$10  
- Remaining: \$20 - \$5 - \$10 = \$5

# 6. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT, 思考樹技術) (🌳)

## Original
By simulating multiple expert “thought branches,” the AI can explore various reasoning paths before selecting the best solution, similar to how a brainstorming session might work.

## Prompt
“Where is the ball if someone drops it between rooms? Let three AI experts analyze the answer.”

## result
1. **Expert A**: It lands in the hallway if the rooms share a corridor.  
2. **Expert B**: It might stop at the threshold if there’s a closed door.  
3. **Expert C**: If the rooms are connected without barriers, it rests somewhere in the middle.  

**Final**: Combining the insights, the ball likely settles at a point equidistant from each room, depending on barriers.

# 7. Variable Prompt Design (🔧)

## Original
We want to create adaptive prompts that change based on different numeric or contextual variables, such as speed, time, or distance.

## Prompt
Create a prompt template for computing travel distance based on `[Speed]` and `[Time]`.

## result
**Adaptive Prompt**  

You are given a speed of `[Speed]` km/h and a travel time of `[Time]` hours. Calculate the total distance traveled, then explain the steps.

- Replace `[Speed]` with the desired velocity value.  
- Replace `[Time]` with the time in hours.

# 8. Historical Chain of Thought (🏛)

## Original
Understanding history often requires step-by-step reasoning about causes and effects. For instance, explaining the fall of the Roman Empire can involve economic, military, and social factors.

## Prompt
Explain the fall of the Roman Empire step-by-step.

## result
1. **Economic Strain**: Heavy taxation and reliance on slave labor weakened the economy.  
2. **Military Overextension**: The Empire stretched across vast territories, depleting resources.  
3. **Internal Conflict**: Political corruption and power struggles undermined stability.  
4. **Barbarian Invasions**: Weakened defenses allowed external tribes to conquer Roman lands.  
5. **Result**: The combined pressures led to the eventual collapse of central authority.

# 9. Financial AI Analysis (💰)

## Original
A restaurant makes \$100 per seat. It has 50 seats and operates 7 days a week. We want an AI to help calculate weekly revenue.

## Prompt
Compute the weekly revenue, then show the breakdown.

## result
1. Revenue per seat per day: \$100  
2. Number of seats: 50  
3. Total daily revenue: \$100 × 50 = \$5,000  
4. Operates 7 days a week: \$5,000 × 7 = \$35,000  
5. **Answer**: The restaurant’s weekly revenue is \$35,000.

---

# 10. Real-Time AI Automation (⏱)

## Original
We have a data sheet with various entries (like temperature, humidity, etc.) updated continuously. We want an AI solution that can analyze these updates in real time and summarize key points.

## Prompt
Automate data extraction and generate a summary for the provided dataset.

## result
**Automated Summary**  
- Average Temperature: 22.3°C  
- Peak Humidity: 85% at 3 PM  
- System Alerts: 2 (filter replacement needed, high humidity spike)  
- Recommended Action: Ventilate during midday to stabilize humidity levels.
