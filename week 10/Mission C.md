# 🤖 Emotional AI Drone Applications – Case Studies 🕊️💡

## Designed by: [Your Name]  
> Based on concepts from DronePaint and Emotional Companion Drone  

---

## Case 1: **Study Soother Drone**

**Ideal:**  
A calming companion drone that detects stress or frustration and soothes the user during long study sessions 📚🧠.

### 📘 Scenario Description:  
In a home study environment, the drone hovers gently nearby. When it detects signs of stress (e.g., furrowed brows, frowns), it emits a soft amber glow and slowly rotates in wide circles to calm the user.

### 🎛️ Interaction Method:  
- Uses camera input to analyze facial tension and stress markers.  
- Triggers a calming response: warm lighting + slow circular hovering motion.

### 🛠️ Required Technologies:
- ✔ **OpenCV Face Tracking** – Locks onto user's face, tracks position.  
- ✔ **DNN-based Emotion Classifier** – Detects "stressed" or "frustrated" expressions.  
- ✔ **Drone SDK** – Commands gentle circular flight and adjusts LED color.  

### 🖼️ Visualization:  
1. User at desk, drone nearby with soft amber glow.

## Case 2: **Joy Amplifier Drone**

**Ideal:**  
A drone that celebrates joy and encourages continued positive emotional states 🌈🎉.

### 📘 Scenario Description:  
During leisure time or breaks, when a smile is detected, the drone flashes vibrant rainbow colors and performs playful "hops" or figure-8 loops in the air.

### 🎛️ Interaction Method:  
- Detects "happy" expressions.  
- Responds with fast, rhythmic flying patterns and changing colorful lights to reflect joy.

### 🛠️ Required Technologies:
- ✔ **OpenCV Face Detection**  
- ✔ **CNN Emotion Classifier for "happy"**  
- ✔ **Motion Pattern SDK** – Hopping, bouncing, figure-8 loops  

### 🖼️ Visualization:  
1. Smiling user looking up.  
2. Drone with shifting color bursts.  
3. Motion path sketch (bounce/loop trail).

## Case 3: **Focus Guardian Drone**

**Ideal:**  
A concentration-focused drone that detects distraction and provides visual and behavioral cues to regain attention 🧘‍♂️🎯.

### 📘 Scenario Description:  
In a quiet workspace, if the drone notices distraction or gaze shift, it slowly dims its lights and moves to recenter itself in the user’s peripheral vision—drawing attention back.

### 🎛️ Interaction Method:  
- Face and eye-tracking detect a lack of attention.  
- Drone repositions to user's line of sight and re-illuminates in cool blue to refocus.

### 🛠️ Required Technologies:
- ✔ **OpenCV with eye gaze tracking**  
- ✔ **Lightweight DNN for emotion + gaze patterns**  
- ✔ **LED + Flight Positioning SDK**  

### 🖼️ Visualization:  
1. User looking away from screen.  
2. Drone shifts flight path into view.  
3. Blue light pulses to gently regain attention.
