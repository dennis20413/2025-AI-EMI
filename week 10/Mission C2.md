# üõçÔ∏è AI-Driven Emotional Retail Analytics System (AERAS)  
> Using Camera-Based Emotion Recognition to Optimize Product Strategy and Customer Experience

---

## üí° Concept Overview  
AERAS is an in-mall AI system embedded in existing security or smart retail cameras to detect and analyze customer emotional reactions when they interact with products. It focuses on identifying **positive intent (purchase or interest)** and **negative emotion signals (disgust, hesitation, disapproval)**. Based on these insights, the system informs **sales optimization** strategies and triggers **targeted product surveys** for items with high negative sentiment ‚Äî thereby reducing costs, minimizing returns, and improving product-market fit.

## üéØ Use Case Scenarios

- üßç A customer picks up a product, examines it, but puts it back with a slight frown or sneer.  
- üòê Another customer holds a product for a long time while visibly hesitating ‚Äî showing confusion or uncertainty.  
- üòÑ A different shopper smiles and proceeds to checkout after engaging with a specific item.  

All these scenarios are captured, classified, and used to adjust merchandising, layout, and inventory planning.

## üß¨ Key System Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| üé• **Emotion Tracking Camera Integration** | Uses OpenCV + DNN models embedded in mall CCTV to detect facial expressions in proximity to shelves. |
| üì¶ **Product-Centric Emotion Mapping** | Matches facial emotion to specific product shelves via position correlation and item IDs. |
| üìä **Negative Feedback Trigger Engine** | Flags items that consistently cause disgust or rejection for deeper investigation. |
| üß™ **Targeted Customer Surveys** | Pushes mini-surveys (via kiosk, app, or QR) to customers who interacted with flagged items. |
| üìà **Sales Heatmaps + Emotion Correlation** | Merges sales data and emotional response metrics to optimize layout and promotional effort. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- ü§ñ **Emotion Detection DNNs** ‚Äì trained on FER+, AffectNet, or custom retail datasets.  
- üìç **Shelf-to-Camera Spatial Mapping** ‚Äì ensures facial data is matched to specific product positions.  
- üìπ **OpenCV / MediaPipe for Real-Time Facial Keypoint Extraction**.  
- üì∂ **Retail Inventory APIs** ‚Äì for real-time tracking of item sales and restocking.  
- üó£Ô∏è **Survey Engine** ‚Äì integrated into existing POS, membership apps, or mall apps.

## üß† Emotional Response Categories

| Emotion | Behavior Indicator | Business Insight |
|--------|--------------------|------------------|
| üòÑ Happy / Excited | Likely to buy | Promote similar items |
| üòê Confused / Hesitant | Wants more info | Improve labeling, staff assistance |
| üò† Disgusted / Rejected | Likely to avoid | Flag for survey and product re-evaluation |

## üìä Survey Trigger Logic (Simplified)

```python
for each interaction:
    if emotion in ['disgust', 'rejection']:
        item_emotion_score[item_id] += 1
    if item_emotion_score[item_id] > threshold:
        trigger_survey(item_id)
```

## üìà Analytics Dashboard Outputs

- üß≠ Emotion Heatmap Overlay (on store map)  
- üìâ High "rejection rate" product reports  
- üìã Survey response summaries per item  
- üí¨ NLP topic clustering from open-ended feedback

---

## üîê Ethical Safeguards

- üôà No personally identifiable data stored  
- üé≠ Blurred face + consent-based survey prompts  
- üîç Aggregated, anonymized behavior reporting only  
- üë• Diverse dataset training to avoid expression bias

## üìò Future Development Ideas

- ü§ù Integrate with AR smart mirrors for in-shelf feedback  
- üõçÔ∏è Dynamic pricing triggers based on interest/emotion correlation  
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Emotion clustering to improve group segmentation (e.g., teens vs. elders)  
- üß† Deep reinforcement learning to auto-adjust product placement based on emotion-sentiment response ratios

> üß† Inspired by affective computing, shopper psychology, and camera-AI integration.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure ethical compliance with local data privacy and AI use regulations.
