## 🛠️ Installation
To get started, you need Python 3.8+ installed. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2025-AI-EMI.git
cd 2025-AI-EMI

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
You can use the AI modules directly through scripts or integrate them into your applications.
