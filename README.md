## Introduction 💡
**AI Project Template** is here to help you kickstart your journey into AI development. This repository offers a solid foundation for:

- Showcasing **best practices** in Machine Learning or Deep Learning.
- Providing a **reusable template** for creating robust AI solutions.
- Illustrating a clear **modular design** that’s easy to adapt.

You’ll find everything from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation scripts and utilities for logging, monitoring, and more. Let’s get started! 🤩

---

## Features 🌟
- **Modular Architecture**: Swap out components (data loaders, model architectures) with minimal effort.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Automated data cleaning, augmentation, and splitting into train/val/test sets.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Configurable training loops, hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive metrics.
- **Deployment Ready**: Docker containers and API scripts to deploy your trained model in production environments.
- **Logging & Visualization**: Integration with [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) or alternative logging tools.
- **Continuous Integration**: Pre-configured GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and more.

---

## Tech Stack 🔧
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+  
- **Frameworks/Libraries**:  
  - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) & [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
