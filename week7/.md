## 1. How do specific prompt keywords affect the image output?  
**📝 A.** You need to describe as many details as possible to control the AI's generation; otherwise, the AI will randomly generate elements you didn’t provide.  

## 2. What image details are hardest to replicate? Why?  
**🧩 A.** Straight lines and blurry areas are the most difficult, as well as floor textures and appearances. This is because it’s hard to fully explain to the AI what the human eye perceives, making it challenging for the AI to understand the complete picture I’m describing.

| 🎯 Challenging Elements | 📋 Reasons |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Straight lines          | AI struggles with mathematical precision of line continuity |
| Blurry visuals          | Lack of real-life light behavior context |
| Floor textures          | Texture nuance is hard to explain in words |
| Facial appearance       | Subtle human features are complex to describe fully |

## 3. How can prompts be refined to get closer to a target visual?  
**🔍 A.** By describing each point in more detail.  
For example:  
> “The product needs to lie flat on a wooden floor, tilted 30° to the right. The floor should be made of light-colored wood with a poor sense of directionality. The surface should feel dry and have very natural-looking lines.”

I believe this kind of detailed description provides a more comprehensive image prompt, allowing the AI to better understand. After all, a picture contains nearly infinite elements. You can only start by defining large areas, then gradually narrow down the scope of the elements you're defining, followed by continuous fine adjustments.

## ✅ Conclusion  
Prompt crafting is both an art and a science 🎨🧪. To achieve the most accurate image generation:

- Be **explicit** with positioning, angles, material, and ambiance  
- Use **natural human perception** as a guide, then break it down in language  
- Consider **revising prompts iteratively** as you evaluate generated outputs  
- Remember: the more abstract or subtle the element, the more carefully it must be described

With patience and detail, your prompts can guide the AI toward remarkable results ✨.
