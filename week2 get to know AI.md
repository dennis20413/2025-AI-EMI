# What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of machines, especially computer systems, to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include **learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language processing**.

## Types of AI
AI is commonly categorized into three types:
1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** – Designed for specific tasks (e.g., Siri, Google Translate).
2. **General AI (Strong AI)** – Theoretical AI that can understand and learn across various domains like humans.
3. **Super AI** – A hypothetical AI surpassing human intelligence.

## Key AI Technologies
- **Machine Learning (ML)** – Algorithms that learn from data.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – AI that understands and generates human language.
- **Computer Vision** – AI that interprets images and videos.
- **Robotics** – AI-driven machines that perform physical tasks.

## Applications of AI
AI is widely used in various industries:
- **Healthcare** (Disease prediction, diagnostics)
- **Finance** (Fraud detection, stock trading)
- **Education** (Personalized learning, AI tutors)
- **Entertainment** (Recommendation systems, game AI)

## Ethical Concerns
Despite its advantages, AI raises concerns about:
- **Bias and Fairness** – AI systems can inherit biases from training data.
- **Privacy Issues** – AI-driven surveillance and data collection.
- **Job Displacement** – Automation replacing human jobs.
